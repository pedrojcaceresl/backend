The AI engineer successfully built TechHub UPE, an MVP platform for tech and other career-related resources in Spanish. The development followed an iterative process, starting from initial feature implementation, followed by multiple rounds of user feedback and bug fixes. Key challenges included establishing a robust authentication and authorization flow for student and company roles, expanding and diversifying content from reliable sources, and ensuring a consistent and functional UI/UX. The AI leveraged  for initial setup and major refactors, and  for incremental updates, with  for verification. Despite significant progress, the trajectory concludes with several critical bugs still reported by the user, notably persistent issues with company account creation, non-functional UI elements, and display inconsistencies, indicating ongoing work on core functionalities.

<product_requirements>
TechHub UPE is a Spanish web platform aggregating third-party content (courses, events, scholarships, news, certifications) and enabling native job postings with application tracking. It primarily focuses on tech careers but also includes other professional fields. Core objectives are everything in one place, redirection with UTM tracking, and distinct roles for Students (profile, CV/portfolio links, saved items, email alerts, apply to jobs) and Companies (verified, post/edit jobs, view applications, ATS-lite with candidate states). The UI/UX should be minimalist, tech-themed (black/celeste), responsive, with clear filters, CTAs, and Google login. Subsequent user feedback requested a dedicated login/registration page with platform info, explicit account creation (student/company) before full dashboard access, expanded non-tech content, functional Saved features, profile file uploads (CV/certs), consistent card design, and fixes for numerous broken buttons, filters, and role assignment bugs.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture:



Detailed Directory Structure:
   - 
      - : Lists all Python dependencies, including To use the fastapi command, please install "fastapi[standard]":

	pip install "fastapi[standard]", , , , , , and .
      - : The core FastAPI application. This file defines all backend API endpoints, handles user authentication, session management, user profile updates, content (courses, events, jobs) retrieval, filtering, and saved items functionality. It interacts directly with the MongoDB database. Significant changes involved implementing auth logic, user roles, saved item endpoints, and a timezone fix.
      - : Contains environment variables specific to the backend, notably  for database connection.
   - 
      - : Manages Node.js dependencies, including React, , ,  components (for shadcn/ui), , etc.
      - : Configuration for Tailwind CSS.
      - : PostCSS configuration.
      - : Stores frontend environment variables, primarily  for API calls.
      - : Contains static assets.
      - : React source code.
         - : The application's entry point.
         - : The main React component. This file manages application-wide state (user authentication, roles), defines routing using , and renders different UI components for the landing page, authentication flow, and authenticated dashboard. It contains logic for fetching data, applying filters, handling user interactions (login, register, save), and displaying dynamic content. It has undergone multiple rewrites to address UI flow, button functionality, and content display.
         - : Contains global styles and Tailwind CSS directives, defining the black and celeste minimalist theme.
         - : Additional global CSS styles.
         - : Directory containing all Shadcn/ui components (e.g., , , , ), used for building the application's modern UI.
         - : A React hook for managing toast notifications.
   - 
      - : A Python script responsible for populating the MongoDB database with initial and updated sample data for courses, events, and job vacancies. This script has been repeatedly modified to expand content, diversify categories, and correct geographical data for job listings.

<pending_tasks>
-   Implement full file upload for CVs/certifications in user profiles.
-   Fix the persistent bug where company account creation defaults to student.
-   Address non-functional Eventos and Guardados buttons.
-   Correct non-working content filters (todas las categorias, todas las vacantes).
-   Ensure UI consistency for all cards (margins, spacing, size).
-   Ensure vacancy buttons correctly redirect to the specified external or internal application pages.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently addressing a fresh set of critical bugs and incomplete features reported by the user in Chat Message 147. These issues include the recurring problem of company account creation defaulting to a student role, several non-functional navigation and filter buttons (Eventos, Guardados, todas las categorias, todas las vacantes), inconsistent UI card dimensions, and the continued absence of the profile file upload feature. Additionally, there was a specific request to ensure onsite vacancies are located in Ciudad del Este, with other cities only for online jobs, and that vacancy buttons correctly redirect.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI modified  (Chat Message 153-154) to adjust the geographical data for job vacancies, aligning with the user's request. Following this, it performed a complete rewrite of  (Chat Message 155-156) with the explicit goal of fixing *all* the recently reported bugs, including the role assignment issue, button functionalities, filters, and UI consistency. The final action in the trajectory (Chat Message 157) indicates that the AI is about to restart the services to apply these latest changes, with the expectation that the fixes for the frontend and data will take effect.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Verify if the company account creation, non-functional buttons, filters, UI card consistency, and vacancy button redirection are fixed after the recent frontend rewrite and service restart.
